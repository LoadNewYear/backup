# Always try to apply for a better job
Do this because staying loyal to a company is never the way to succeed in life.

"Stay loyal to the people, not the company"
Staying loyal to people you admire is a great way to follow up on their success because they are doing something correctly and you should try to replicate that.

While staying loyal to the company is not worth doing because, no matter how much the company will try to convince you otherwise, it is *not* like your family. It is just a big corporation looking to profit off of what you are doing. It will complain when you quit work without a 2 weeks notice. But it will not even give you a 10 minutes notice before a huge layoff.
