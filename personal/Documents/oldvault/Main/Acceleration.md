# Acceleration
This is the measure of the rate at which velocity is increasing.

>Acceleration = $$\frac{ChangeInVelocity}{TimeTaken}$$

>If the velocity of an object changes from initial value **u** to **v** in time **t** then 
>$$acceleration = \frac{v - u}{t}$$
>In summary, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time.

> [!Note]
> If we follow Newton's second law ($force = mass \times acceleration$), we can get the formula for acceleration as follow $$acceleration = \frac{force}{mass}$$
