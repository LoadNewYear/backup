Consider the velocity-time graph of an object that moves under uniform acceleration **AS**, but no **U = 0**.

Initial velocity of the object is **U** (At point **A**) and then it increases to **V** (At point **B**) in time **T**.

The velocity changes at a uniform rate.

Perpendicular line BC and BE.
$$
OA = U
$$
$$ BC = V $$
Change in velocity time time **T**.
$$BD = BC - CD$$
From the graph:
$$BC = BD + DC$$
$$BC = BD + OA$$
Putting value of $BC = V$ and $OA = U$ 
$$V = BD + U$$
$$BD = V-U$$
We get 
$$V=BD+U$$
$$BD = V - U$$
From the velocity-time graph, the acceleration of the object is given by
$$a= \frac{ChangeInVelocity}{TimeTaken}$$
$$= \frac{BD}{AD} = \frac{BD}{DC}$$
Putting $OC = T$, we get
$$a = \frac {BC}{T}$$
From equation $1$ and $2$
$$v = a + at$$
