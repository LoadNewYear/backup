# {{Title}}
The change in position of an object is called motion. Which is decided by distance or displacement.

[[Measuring The Rate Of Motion|The rate of motion can be measured]]

When a body travels in a straight line, it is called linear motion.

There are two ways to represent motion:
- [[Scalar Quantities]]
- [[Vector Quantities]]

The quantity that specifies both speed and direction is called velocity.
The rate of its motion can be measured in [[Acceleration|acceleration]].

There is also a [[Graphical Representation Of Motion|graphical representation of motion]]

There are several equations of motion:
1. v = u + nt
2. s = u + $\frac{1}{2}$
3. 2as = v^2

In all of the above equations, s = Distance

There are also some [[Equations For Velocity-Time Relation|equations for velocity-time relation]] and [[Equations For Position-Time Relation|equations for position-time relation]]
