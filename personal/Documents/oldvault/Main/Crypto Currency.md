# Crypto Currency
Crypto currency is an alternative form of currency stored online, often tied to storage in a server or a physical storage solution like an HDD or SSD. It cannot be stolen from people physically unless the HDD or SSD storing it is stolen but the chances of that are pretty low since they are usually inside of a computer and only taken out not that often.

Some cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Mario coin, etc.  These all have different values tied to them, as of writing this the value of these are $54,334.90, $2,297.61, $0.000257 respectively. 

As you can see from the number above, investing in crypto is a high-risk high-reward situation. If somebody had bought 1 Bitcoin when it started at the price of $0.0009, it would have been turned into $54,334.90 by now.

But if somebody had bought 1 Mario coin when it started, the price would have reduced to $0.000257 by now. Which would have been a huge loss.
