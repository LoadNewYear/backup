# Amino Acids
When [[Proteins|proteins]] are digested or broken down, they turn into amino acids. Although there are 500 types of natural amino acids, only 22 are necessary for life. Amino acids and [[Proteins|proteins]] are the two most essential things needed for a life form to exist (apart from water).

That's why when scientists look for life or potential of life on another planet. They first look for whether there is amino acids, [[Proteins|proteins]], and water or not.
