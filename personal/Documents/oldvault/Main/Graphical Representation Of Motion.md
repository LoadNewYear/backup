Change in position of an object with time can be represented by the distance-time graph. In this graph, time is taken along **X** axis and distance is taken along **Y** axis. This graph can be applied at [[Uniform Motion|uniform speed]], [[Non-Uniform Motion|non-uniform speed]] and at rest.

This shows that the distance traveled by an object is directly proportional to time.

We can use the distance-time graph to determine the speed of an object.

To do so, take a small section **AB** of the distance-time graph. Draw a parallel line along the **X-Axis** from point **A** and another line parallel to the y-axis. These two lines meet each other at point **C** to form a triangle **ABC**.

**A-C** denotes the time interval **t2-t1**. **B-C** denotes the corresponding distance **S2-S1**. Speed **D** of the object can be represented as $$\frac{S2-S1}{t2-t1}$$

Velocity-time graph

The variation in velocity with time for an object moving in a straight line can be represented by the velocity-time graph.

Time is represented along with the **X-Axis**. Velocity is represented along with the **Y-Axis**.

If the object moves at uniform velocity, the height of tis velocity-time graph will not change with time. It will be a straight parallel line to the **X-Axis**.
