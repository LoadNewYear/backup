# Equations For Position-Time Relation
Let us consider that an object has traveled distance **S** in time **T** under uniform acceleration.

The distance traveled by the object is enclosed within **OABC** under [[Equations For Velocity-Time Relation|velocity-time graph]] **AB**.

Thus, distance traveled by the object is given by
$$S = area OABC$$
$$= AreaOfRectange + AreaOfTriange ABD$$
$$= OAOC + \frac{1}{2}[AB \times BD]$$
Putting $OA = U$, $OC =$, $AD = T$, $BD=AT$
$$S = U = T + \frac{1}{2}(T \times AT)$$
$$S=UT + \frac {1}{2} \times at^2$$

From the [[Equations For Velocity-Time Relation|velocity-time graph]] in time T, moving under uniform [[Acceleration|acceleration]] **A** is given by the area enclosed within a trapezium OABC under the graph.
$$ S = AreaOfTrapeziumOABC $$
$$ = \frac{(OA B) \times OC}{2}$$

Putting $OA = U, BC=V, OC=T,$
$$ S = \frac{(U + V)t}{2}$$
From [[Equations For Velocity-Time Relation|velocity-time realation]] we get:
$$T = \frac{V - U}{A}$$
