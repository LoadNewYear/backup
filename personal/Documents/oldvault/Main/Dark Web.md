# Dark Web
The dark web is a place where no laws apply, it can only be accessed through a dark web browser like tor. The domains there are not regular domains like www.youtube.com they are a mix of jumbled letters, words, and symbols. These letters, words, and symbols represent the id of a device which cannot be taken away unless the device is stolen or sold.

Some youtubers like Stormedy pretend to go on the dark web buy thing to entertain their young and foolish audience. While in reality, they are only just buying things from the local store and putting graffiti on them to make it seem more interesting.

Mostly only [[Crypto Currency|crypto]] is accepted on the dark web.
