Ron, the woodcutter was cutting wood in the forest that he owned. It was apparent from his facial expression as he cut wood, he censured the chopping of trees. But the truth was, his wife chastised him at home if he did not bring home any money. He vindicated his conscience by planting 2 trees for every tree the he chopped but he was still ambivalent.

Ron's wife, Linda, thought that the chipping of trees was innocuous which was the reason she upbraided him when he didn't chop any trees and got money by selling the wood.

Ron was galvanized by the thought that someday he would make Linda realize that the chopping of trees should be a crime. Even the town mayor had given Ron a harangue when he tried to explain why the mayor should incriminate the chopping of trees but Ron suspected that it was due to the mayor's venality that this happened.

Ron thought he had found an artful way of getting around the castigation which was still extant by planting trees but when his wife found out, she got mad and said that he was wasting his time by doing so.

All of this wood-chopping while battling his conscience was very enervating.

Kwasitou, a man whose age was never disclosed but he looked very ancient, was the only person who venerated the ideals of Ron. It was a very equivocal around why the chopping of trees was encouraged so much nowadays.

Although Kwasitou was a veracious man, he wasn't of much help as he was mercurial as the ground when it came to anything. He was gregarious as a log. Ron's understanding of Kwasitou was amorphous at best. This was the only person Ron could find who was an iconoclast like him.
